"""Diurnal emission-timing profile e(t) for the transport modulation (§3.4b).

Kandy's local emissions are weighted here as ~90% road-traffic FOR THEIR TIMING ONLY. That
is NOT a mass share: the Katugastota PMF measures traffic at 7.6% of ambient PM2.5 mass and
biomass burning at 14.1% (F.66), and GEOS-CF speciation gives OC/BC = 13.8, a biomass
fingerprint (F.93). What is measured is that traffic dominates the local increment's
sub-daily CLOCK -- 3.67x stronger at rush hours, zero at midnight (F.23). The diurnal cycle
therefore follows the road-traffic profile, reinforced by a smaller domestic-combustion
(cooking) term on the same morning/evening hours. The traffic shape follows
the EDGAR road-transport hour-of-day temporal profile (Crippa et al. 2020, Sci. Data);
domestic follows cooking studies (morning + heavier-evening peaks). Bimodal, mean 1.

This supplies the emission *clock* the spatial modulations otherwise lack: without it
the transport hotspot is gated by boundary-layer height alone and peaks through the dead
of night (low BLH) when emissions are minimal. With e(t) the hotspot follows the morning
and evening rush, when emissions and a shallow layer coincide.

# ── STATUS CORRECTED 2026-09-01 (ledger F.66/F.71/F.93). THIS IS A TIMING WEIGHT, NOT A MASS
# SHARE, and it must never be described as "Kandy is ~90% vehicular".
#
# REFUTED -- the mass claim. The Katugastota source-apportionment study (Seneviratne et al.
# 2017) measures traffic at 7.6% of ambient PM2.5 mass and biomass burning at 14.1%: burning is
# roughly twice traffic, so the vehicular share is wrong by an order of magnitude as a mass
# statement. Two independent lines agree -- PM2.5 does not track the TROPOMI NO2 column
# (r = +0.084 even within an hour of overpass), and GEOS-CF speciation gives OC/BC = 13.8, a
# biomass-burning fingerprint where traffic-dominated aerosol runs ~1-2. A 20-site study
# resolves it by geography: traffic predominant in the urban core, firewood co-dominant there
# and dominant rurally, so a defensible core mix is vehic ~0.5-0.6, burn ~0.3-0.4.
#
# SURVIVES -- the timing claim, which is what this constant actually weights. Sri Lankan public
# holidays act as a natural experiment: they remove local activity and leave transboundary
# transport untouched, so the holiday-minus-working-day difference at hour h estimates the local
# emission clock. It measured the effect as 3.67x stronger at rush hours and zero at midnight --
# the vehicle signature in TIME. The two findings are about different quantities and both hold.
